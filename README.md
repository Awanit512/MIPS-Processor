Verilog code for a 32-bit pipelined MIPS processor.

Datapath diagram with control signals is included in PDF format.

Combination of gate-level, dataflow and behavioural modelling.

Features:
* Instruction Memory for 32 32-bit MIPS instructions.
* 32 32-bit Data Memory locations.
* Instruction Memory consisting of arithmetic, logical, branch, jump, and memory-access instructions. Immediate arguments and argument registers are hard-coded.
* TRAP destination is generally OS-specific, and has been left to zero here.
